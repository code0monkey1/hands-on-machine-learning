# Hands-On Machine Learning - Tutorials

Here you'll find some basic examples of usage for each required Python library, as well as examples of required basic math (such as linear algebra) and other related materials.

To run a specific Python code from this folder, remember to start the virtual environment for the project and install the dependencies using:
```bash
poetry shell
```
```bash
poetry install
```
Then, use the following command (from the root folder) to run a specific Python file (e.g., `./numpy/main.py`):
```shell
poetry run python tutorials/numpy/main.py
```
