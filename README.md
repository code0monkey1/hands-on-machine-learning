# Hands-On Machine Learning

This repository was created to document my progress and learnings from the book ["Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition" by Aurélien Géron](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/).

## Overview

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and projects related to the concepts covered in the book.

## Getting Started

You can find the official tutorials page here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/index.ipynb

And the official code examples here: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3

To ensure a consistent environment for working locally with Python, you can use `pyenv` for managing Python versions and `Poetry` for dependency management.
In the `tutorials` directory you can find some basic instruction on how to install and use `pyenv` and `Poetry`.

> Alternatively you can use Google Colab to write and execute python code through the browser.

It's also recommended to have a prior knowledge of the following Python libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`. In the `tutorials` directory, you'll also find some basic examples of usage for each of these libraries, as well as examples of required basic math (such as linear algebra) and other related materials.

## Projects

In the `projects` directory, you'll find the source code of the project developed in each chapter.
